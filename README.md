Managing assets (images, SVGs)

Credits are due to [Ezequiel Garrido](https://unsplash.com/@zegarr?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText) for being the author of the background image.

Aside: Using the (CSSOM)[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CSS_Object_Model] to display/remove the background image depending on which tab is currently being shown.
